# Covid-data-prediction
Covid Data Prediction is a Machine Learning project to check whether the patient is Covid positive or negative. This is a classification problem.  
Data preprocessing, Feature selection, Model Building, Evaluation & Model Selection are the different steps followed in the project.
The machine learning algorithms used are Logistic Regression, Decision Trees & Random Forest.

Out of all the Random Forest algorithm gave the best accuracy, best recall value and the least type 2 error.
1. Recall value for:
class 0 is 0.85
class 1 is 0.72          
2. The accuracy 78%.
